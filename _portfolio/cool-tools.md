## SQL Server Development & Performance Tuning

_Note - all licensing costs are for general reference only, look at supplier for up to date pricing metrics._

| Name | Description | Cost |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| [Sql Sentry Plan Explorer](http://bit.ly/2qpm2iE)     | Better review of plan adjustments, and allows filtering plans for easier review of the visual diagram. [They made the pro tool free in 2016](http://bit.ly/2qphhW7), making it one of the best options for easily reviewing plan performance changes | $0 |
| [StatisticsParser](http://bit.ly/2qp2U40)     | Scalability testing for query changes can be difficult to guage with execution plans and elapsed execution time. Reads/Write summary from setting "statistics io, time on" can help better assess the potential percent increase/decrease in performance better than just using elapsed time. | $0 |
| [SqlPrompt](http://bit.ly/1QSfMUl)     | RedGate's premiere sql-server intellisense replacement that works in Visual Studio and SSMS. This has better snippet handling, automatic formatting that is brilliantly implemented, and a great productivity enhancements to help workflow. As a member of the Friends of Red Gate program, I'm a staunch supporter of this fantastic tool. | $369 |
| [dbForge Event Profiler](http://bit.ly/2qkYsH5)     | A welcome replacement for running Sql Profiler, this tool leverages Extended events, but allows easily working with the results in a nice sortable grid. A few minor bugs on not saving some filters, but for the most part even with those it's a fantastic tool and my favorite trace utility. | $0 |
|[RedGate ANTS Performance Profiler](http://bit.ly/2uN4gec)| A great way to immediately identify what is making an application run slow. Is it the database calls or bit of unoptimized code that is bringing down the internet? This is a great tool to find that out. For a full review, take a look at my article on it by looking at [ANTS Performance Profiler](..\_posts\2017-07-21-ants-performance-profiler-for-the-sql-server-dev.md) | $0 |
